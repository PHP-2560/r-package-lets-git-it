```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The `grow()` function takes in the size of a loan, its interest rate, and the number of times its interest is compounded. For example, if you owed 100,000 USD at 7.5% interest, you would expect this debt to become 107,500 USD after one year:

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
library(MedLoans)
grow(100000, .075, n=1)
```

It is less intuitive, however, what your debt would look like after it is compounded 8 times:

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
grow(100000, .075, n=8)
```
