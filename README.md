A package by Kevin Chen and Jon Spiegel

We will be creating a package to help medical students do financial planning and choose between medical school financing options. We believe that this package will be helpful because medical school is very expensive, and it can be very difficult for people to find good information about financial planning.

Jon came up with the project idea and mainly compiled the functions.
Kevin tied everything together, working especially on getting the shiny app formatted and running.

Our final product can be found at the repository titled final-project-medloans.

Best team ever! :D
